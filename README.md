## Inspiration
We wanted to build a **Decentralized Voting System using Blockchain** .After read the hackathon readme file we wanted to made a vue app on the algo-testnet . In their People can Vote their Favourite team . we are making this voting app of the state cricket teams.
 **Using blockchain, voting process can be made more secure, transparent, immutable, and reliable

## Advantages
* You can vote anytime/anywhere (During Pandemics like COVID-19 where it’s impossible to hold elections physically.
* Secure
* Immutable
* Faster
* Transparent

## How we built it
We Know that :-
"A blockchain is a time-stamped decentralized series of fixed records that contains data of any size is controlled by a large network of computers that are scattered around the globe and not owned by a single organization. Every block is secured and connected with each other using hashing technology which protects it from being tempered by an unauthorized person."
* The contracts.py file contains the smart contract code and is written with the PyTeal library. In this example, a new smart contract is deployed for each new auction. And as we described in the overview, every auction needs to support creating, setting up, placing a bid, and closing out an auction. In a bit, we’ll take you through where each of these scenarios is represented in the code.
* Only the owner of the web-app can set winner and add a contest because if we gave permission to all then it's can not secure.

## Challenges we ran into
We made this application using vue as a frontend and pyteal as our backend.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
* My first Dapp in the Algorand Blockchain.
* It's takes more than 30hours but finally it's over you can try[link](https://algo-voting.vercel.app/)

## What's next for ALGO VOTING
We are adding Some more feature soon.
